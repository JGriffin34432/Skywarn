# Commands

`!weather <city/zipcode>` - Displays weather based on the closest city near your zip code/city. To do a city name you must do it the way i have it typed out or it will not work. <!weather baltimore,md,us> and cities with two words you must do this <!weather severna+park,md,us> Also some city names do not work, so keep trying until one does. Its not the bot, its the OpenWeatherMap API.
