# Commands

`!weather <city/zipcode>` - Displays weather based on the closest city near your zip code/city. Also to do a city name, you must do it like this `!weather baltimore,md,us` but if it is like `!weather greenville spartanburg,sc,us` it will not work. So that means I recommend using a zip code until this bug is fixed.

`!eas` - Displays info about EAS.

`!help` - Displays help about the bot.

`!ping` - Pings the bot to see if it is responding.

`!announcement [text]` - Will make the bot say an announcement and tag everyone

`!cat` - Will send a random cat image

`!say [text]` - Will make the bot say something

`!invite` Displays invite link to invite the bot to a discord server.
